* You should open `regedit` and find this path: `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\Advanced`
create a new 32-bit DWORD value and name it: `TaskbarSi` with a value of `0` then restart your PC or restart your `explorer`
you can try with the values `1` and `2` if `0` doesn't work for you.
* Available Resolutions: `1360x768`

# Limitations
As all Necroxia Origin players already know... This server punishes those who use programs to take advantage of others who don't use them, so the owners applied
some restrictions to client 10, basically you can only use spells from client 10 in some cities and in SM rooms.

I don't go to the trouble of adding too many features to the bot, as it literally doesn't work for 90% of the cases.
However if you have `ticket`, `scroll` and `stamina recover` you can take advantage of this BOT and up many levels automatically in SM rooms.

# Recommendations
Don't use the bot in non-allowed areas, otherwise the bot will start casting spells like crazy. due to customer 10 restrictions in these areas.
Try to have a good internet connection, the BOT will help you level up, it doesn't work miracles.
Do not tell anyone about the BOT and do not tell anyone that you use it. (Unless it's someone trustworthy)
